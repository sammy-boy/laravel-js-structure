   # Laravel JS Package

   A Laravel package for setting up a structured JavaScript service architecture with reusable client-side components.

   ## Installation

   To install the package, follow these steps:

   1. **Add the package to your Laravel project**:

      Open your Laravel project's `composer.json` file and add the following under `repositories`:

      ```json
      {
          "repositories": [
              {
                  "type": "vcs",
                  "url": "https://github.com/sammy-boy/laravel-js-structure.git"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

      Then require the package:

      ```bash
      composer require your-vendor/laravel-js-package
      ```

      Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and the repository name, and `your-vendor` with your vendor name.

   2. **Publish the JavaScript assets**:

      After installation, publish the assets using the following Artisan command:

      ```bash
      php artisan vendor:publish --tag=js-assets
      ```

      This will copy the JavaScript files into the `public/js/` directory of your Laravel project.

   ## Usage

   After publishing, you can include the JavaScript files in your Blade views like this:

   ```html
   <script src="{{ asset('js/client/AuthService.js') }}"></script>
   <script src="{{ asset('js/main/auth.js') }}"></script>
   <script src="{{ asset('js/init.js') }}"></script>
   ```

   You can now use the services defined in your JavaScript files throughout your application.
